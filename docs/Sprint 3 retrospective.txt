Went well:
Merge requests were handled better
Architecture has been improved
Some of the team checked pylint

Needs improvement:
Merge request can still be improved even more
Sprint is not completely finished before the sprint-meeting (merge requests created but not merged etc)
Pylint needs to be checked even more with every merge
Testing needs to be done continuously by the person coding

Next step:
Assign people to check merge requests
Daniel -> Twan -> Rick -> Pelle -> Simon -> Daniel
Link merge requests to issues
Test driven development
