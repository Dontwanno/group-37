Retrospective

Went well:

Getting Git working
Even a could have tasks were completed
The interface looks nice for a console interface
We got a better idea of how to plan tasks
We got a better idea of how coding with git and cross requirements limit us

Needs improvement:

The difficulty points assigned were not accurate
Google calendar was hardest
All the other tasks were ~ the same difficulty
Tasks and cross requirements were not defined clearly enough
We did not think enough about the coding process in the planning
The tasks were not all completed in time
Everyone did not have the same expectation of the shippable product

Next steps:

Define requirements more elaborately (including inputs, outputs)
Define cross requirements between tasks
Be more careful and test before pushing
Don’t merge carelessly
For now, we don’t give difficulty ratings to tasks
