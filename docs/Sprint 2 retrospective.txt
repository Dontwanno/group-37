Retrospective 2

Went well:

Most of the tasks are finished

There was a shippable product at the end of the sprint
Most tasks were finished on time

Needs improvement:

Menu is not in the main file yet
Some errors in the code
For those concerned (implement testing)
Too many files

Next step:

Testing
Make menu and main one thing
Merge some files
