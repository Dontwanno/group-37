Went well:
No major issues with the merges and branches from previous sprints
Most of the Pylint issues have been taken care of, still a few remaining that need fixing A.S.A.P.
Integration with multiple days works now, also, overlapping is fixed now

Needs improvement:
We now have issues with Git because people were working simultaneously on the same files.
Better communication. At the last sprint we made agreements when people would work on certain issues so as not to get in each other's way. When this didnâ€™t happen and this was not communicated, it caused a delay in our sprint.
Write description + dod for every issue created on gitlab

Next step:
Integrating google API
Integrating weather API
Add on requirements in the report
Merge locally
Mocking for testing and bonus points
Fix last remaining Pylint issues
